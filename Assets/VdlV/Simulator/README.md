# Simulator

* `Variables` - commonly used `TED.Vars`
* `Functions` - wrappers for `TED.Functions` and `TED.PrimitiveTests` - underlying members and methods from `Utilities` and `ValueTypes`
* `StaticTables` - all static tables (like normal Datalog EDB's - though these can be extensional or intensional)
* `Time` - the ticking clock mechanism that progresses with the simulation (keeps time)
* `TalkOfTheTown` - the actual simulator
